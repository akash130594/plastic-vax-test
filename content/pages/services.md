    Plastic Wax studios has its own state of the art MOCAP stage that allows us
    to accelerate the early stages of previz into animation, giving more time on
    look development, refinement and importantly iterative collaboration.

    Plastic Wax houses its own on site 24 camera VICON mocap stage, which is able to capture and stream live motion capture data real-time.  This rapid and cost effective form of ‘in-engine previz’ allows us to assemble a working edit immediately after the mocap shoot allowing for rapid turnaround of animatics during the early stages of the project. We also have the latest Faceware systems which allow us to do detailed facial capture for our clients.

    We provide world class acting and stunt talent, choreographing and directing their performance.  We’re able to simultaneously capture their body and facial performance, which is retargeted to the actual 3D models for us to see on set in real-time.  And with our highly detailed facial rigging systems, we can ensure those very subtle and nuanced performances is captured and applied to our 3D characters.

    Here at Plastic Wax we live and breathe this space.

    We love the magic of 'realtime animation', and the creative power it affords our game centric studio team who speak a cinematic language. With added efficiency and creative spontaneity, it's the marriage of filmic vision with the technical in-engine know-how that has been the cornerstone of our success.

    And we've been doing this now for 22 years, distilling down our in-house mocap tech, and working intimately across both game and cinematic productions.

    Our vision is to create a true film pipeline in Unreal, with realtime cinematography, and offering an array of customisable toolsets including remote-camera viewing and recording. We believe that 'realtime animation' will revolutionise the animation industry, and we're proud to be one of the pioneers with a solid track record to meet this exciting new future.
